	And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
	Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
	Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
	And this our life exempt from public haunt
	Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
	Sermons in stones and brothers in exile,
	Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
	Than that of painted pomp? Are not these are counsellors
	That feelingly persuade me what I am.'

	And this our life exempt from peri
