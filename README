An implementation of the markov model, used as a statistical model for text
generation, based on character frequency.

Usage: `Java FrequencyCounter <k> <M> <filename>`
    where:
        * k is the Markov order
        * M (optional) is the number of characters to print out
        * filename is the name of the input file

Classes:
    * MyHashMap -- Implementation of a HashMap using separate chaining backed by
      LinkedLists. Used in TextGenerator to map substrings to their Markov
      objects.

    * Markov -- Represents a k-character substring of text, and the characters
      which follow in the original text (along with the frequency counts of the
      substring and its suffix characters).

    * FrequencyCounter -- (Test program) Counts the frequencies of k-length
      substrings of input text.

    * SuffixCounter -- Similar to FrequencyCounter, but also counts the suffixes
      for each k-length substring in the text.

    * TextGenerator -- the main class. Reads an input file, generating a
      MyHashMap which maps substrings to their Markov objects. It then
      constructs an output string (starting with the beginning input text),
      which chooses each character based on how likely it is to follow the
      previous k characters.


A silly example:

AMIENS	Happy is your grace,
	That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
	Sweet are the uses of adversity,
	Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
	Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
	And this our life exempt from public haunt
	Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
	Sermons in stones and blows upon my body,
	Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
	'This is no flattery: these woods
	More free from peril than the envious court?
	Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,
	The seasons' difference, as the icy fang
	And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
	Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
	Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
	And this our life exempt from public haunt
	Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
	Sermons in stones and brothers in exile,
	Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
	Than that of painted pomp? Are not these are counsellors
	That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
	Sweet are the uses of adversity,
	Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,

	And this our life exempt from peri
